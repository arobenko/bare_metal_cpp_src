=== Other ===

There are many other peripherals and/or protocols (such as I2S, USB, one wire). The implementation 
and the main concepts should be pretty similar to the peripherals covered so far. At this stage I 
do not plan to do it in this book. At least not in the near future.

Various micro-controllers may also support http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_memory_access[DMA] access 
to some peripherals. In this case the `Character` **Driver** that was covered in <<peripherals-uart>> 
chapter must be replaced with some kind of `Block` **Driver**, that will allow issuing of multiple 
read/write requests at the same time and will receive only "operation complete" notifications from 
the **Device**. I leave implementation of it as an excercise for the reader. At least for now.
