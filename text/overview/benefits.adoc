=== Benefits of C++ ===
The primary reason to prefer C++ over C is **code reuse**. Thanks to templates, 
it is much easier to implement generic piece of code that can be reused between 
projects in C++ than in C. When implementing everything from scratch, then 
probably using C++ instead of C won't give any significant advantage in terms 
of development effort, maybe even extend it. However, once generic components 
have been developed, the whole development process for next projects will be 
much easier and faster, thanks to reuse of the former.
