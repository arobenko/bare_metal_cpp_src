== Overview ==
Once in a while I encounter a question whether C++ is suitable for embedded development and 
bare metal development in particular. There are multiple articles of how C++ is superior to C, 
that everything you can do in C you can do in C++ with a lot of extras, and that it should 
be used even with bare metal development. However, I haven't found many practical guides or 
tutorials of how to use C++ superiority and boost development process compared to conventional 
approach of using “C” programming language. With this book I hope to explain and show examples 
of how to implement **soft** real time systems without prioritising interrupts and without 
any need for complex real time task scheduling. Hopefully it will help someone to get started 
with using C++ in embedded bare metal development.
